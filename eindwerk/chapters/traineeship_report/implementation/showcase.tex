The showcase uses the architecture as a base and adds features referencing the research topic. The simulation image of the architecture is used as a base for the one in the showcase. Three more images are added for containers that run a \acs{slam} algorithm, a path planning algorithm, and a \acs{qrcode} detector. These algorithms and the detector are clarified in the chapter of the research topic.

The showcase is used to conduct research, visualize this research, and show the capabilities of the architecture. Figure~\ref{fig:showcase_containers} visualizes which containers are run in the showcase and how there are connected.
