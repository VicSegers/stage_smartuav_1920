The showcase uses the architecture as a base and adds features referencing the research topic. The simulation image of the architecture is used as a base for the one in the showcase. It adds support for a VLP-16 Velodyne \acs{lidar}, allows OctoMap in RViz, and provides a \acs{qrcode} detector. A new image is added for a container than runs a \acs{slam} algorithm. Multiple versions of this image are made for different algorithms, such as \textit{hdl\_graph\_slam} and \acs{rtabmap}. These algorithms are explained in the chapter of the research topic.

The showcase is used to conduct research, visualize this research, and show the capabilities of the architecture. The main addition to the architecture is the implementation of the \acs{slam} algorithms and their dependencies.
