Python is a high\hyp{}level general\hyp{}purpose programming language, created by Guido van Rossum. It is developed as an interpreted language, the code is automatically compiled to byte code and executed. Python's philosophy emphasizes code readability achieved by its use of significant whitespace. Mostly Python is not used for its speed or performance because several studies have shown that it is slower than widely\hyp{}used programming languages, such as Java and C++. However, Python has the option to be extended in C and C++ to speed it up and even be used for compute\hyp{}intensive tasks. Its strong structuring constructs and its consistent use of objects enables programmers to write clear and logical applications. \cite{kuhlman2009python}

\acs{ros} is mainly developed using two languages, C++ and Python. For this project Python was the obvious choice because of its simplicity and readability. The used packages are written in C++ for performance.
