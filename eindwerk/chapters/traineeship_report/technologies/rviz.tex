RViz is a three\hyp{}dimensional visualization tool for \acs{ros} applications. It can provide a view of the robot model and the captured sensor information. RViz can display data from sensors like cameras and lasers in a \acs{2d} or \acs{3d} environment. In order to get the data sent through \acs{ros}, it has to be launched as a node so it can listen to all topics needed. \cite{aws_robomaker_developer_guide}

This project uses RViz to visually test the written and implemented code. It allows playback of previously saved missions and visualizing all captured points throughout that mission. RViz can function as a replacement for Gazebo's visuals when Gazebo is running headless to increase performance.
