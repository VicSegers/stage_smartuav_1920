MAVROS is an open\hyp{}source translation layer between \acs{ros} and \acs{mavlink}. \acs{mavlink} is a lightweight messaging protocol for communicating with unmanned vehicles. The key features of \acs{mavlink} are its efficiency, reliability, support of many programming languages, capability up to 255 concurrent systems on the network, and ability to enable offboard and onboard communications. \acs{mavlink} 1 has just eight bytes overhead per packet and \acs{mavlink} 2 has fourteen to increase its security. Therefore this protocol is very well suited for applications with very limited communication bandwidth. \cite{mavlink_developer_guide}

In this project, MAVROS is used for communication between the written code and the drone. MAVROS allows for coding on a higher abstraction, with the use of its library.
