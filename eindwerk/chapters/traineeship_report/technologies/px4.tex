The PX4 Autopilot is an open\hyp{}source autopilot system designed for low\hyp{}cost \acsp{uav}. The autopilot presents the current de-facto standard in the \acs{uav} industry and is the leading research platform for \acsp{uav}. Furthermore, it also has some successful applications for underwater vehicles and boats. The PX4 Autopilot provides guidance, navigation, control algorithms, and estimators for attitude and position. Thanks to its more flexible hardware and software, modifications are allowed to satisfy special requirements. \cite{px4} \cite{dronecode_projects}

Because the software is supported in multiple simulation choices, such as Gazebo. The PX4 Autopilot uses \acs{mavlink} as a communication tool. Therefore it can be controlled by \acs{ros}. The build\hyp{}in mode \textit{OFFBOARD} provides full control of the vehicle. \cite{mimmoimplementation}

The PX4 software also provides a model of a 3DR Iris Quadrotor that is compatible with Gazebo. The Iris is the default fixed\hyp{}wing \acs{uav} of PX4. The type of \acs{uav} is not important when simulating, therefore the default is kept.
