This section describes why these technologies are implemented in this project and how they interact with each other. It also explains the reasoning behind the two large components that this project contains. Those are the architecture and the showcase. The architecture is a clean environment made for developing \acs{uav} applications. The showcase in the implementation of the research topic with the architecture as a base.

All elements of the project are built in Docker containers. This allows for a consistent and clean environment for development. As well as a more robust and realistic system. In a real\hyp{}life scenario, not all components are in direct contact with another. For example, the onboard controller of one \acs{uav} does not share files with the onboard controller of another. This multi\hyp{}container environment communicates through a Docker network.
