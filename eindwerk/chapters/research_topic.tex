The research topic of this paper contains, the autonomous navigation of a \acs{uav} in a dynamic indoor environment. Since this topic encloses multiple aspects, it has been subdivided into multiple sub\hyp{}questions. They each answer a part of the research topic and are combined in the conclusion.

\begin{outline}
  \1 What defines a dynamic indoor environment?
    \2 What is the definition of a dynamic environment?
    \2 What is an indoor environment?
  \1 How is a \acs{uav} able to orientate in its environment?
    \2 How can a \acs{uav} observe its environment?
      \3 Wich sensors can a \acs{uav} use for observing its environment?
    \2 How is a \acs{uav} able to execute mapping and localization?
      \3 Which SLAM algorithms are eligible for a \acs{uav}?
  \1 How is a path of a \acs{uav} to a goal planned?
    \2 What defines an executable path?
    \2 How is the goal of a \acs{uav} defined?
    \2 Which path planning algorithms are usable?
  \1 How can a \acs{uav} execute a path?
  \1 What are the unsolved difficulties?
