The research topic of this paper contains, the autonomous navigation of a \acs{uav} in a dynamic indoor environment. Since this topic encloses multiple aspects, it has been subdivided into multiple sub\hyp{}questions. They each answer a part of the research topic and are combined in the conclusion.
