In an era where drones are becoming more advanced, cheaper, and more socially accepted. Drones can perform tasks no one would have thought a few years ago. What if these tasks could be executed without human interference? Currently, cars are on the verge of driving fully autonomous. Then it is also possible for drones to fly autonomously.

This paper will focus on the autonomous navigation of a \acs{uav} in an indoor dynamic environment. A practical application could be to view or grab packages in a warehouse, another application could be the complete \acs{3d} mapping of a building.

To promote the development of drone applications, an architecture for their development is created. This architecture is a multi\hyp{}container Docker system, with Gazebo as the simulator of drones and the environment, and \acs{ros} to combine all used technologies. This project, with the architecture as a backbone, has a showcase where the conducted research is implemented.
