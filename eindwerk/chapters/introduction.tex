In an era where \acsp{uav} are becoming more advanced, cheaper, and more socially accepted, they can perform tasks no one would have thought a few years ago. What if these tasks could be executed without human interference? Currently, cars are on the verge of driving fully autonomous. Then would it not be possible for \acsp{uav} to fly autonomously aswell?

This paper will focus on the autonomous navigation of a \acs{uav} in an indoor dynamic environment. A practical application could be to view or grab packages in a warehouse, another application could be the complete \acs{3d} mapping of a building.

To promote the development of \acs{uav} applications, an architecture for their development is created. This architecture is a multi\hyp{}container Docker system, with Gazebo as the simulator of \acsp{uav} and the environment, and \acs{ros} to combine all used technologies. This project, with the architecture as a backbone, has a showcase where the conducted research is demonstrated.
