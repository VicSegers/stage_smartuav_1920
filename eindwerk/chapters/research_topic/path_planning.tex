Path planning is the task of finding a continuous path from the start to the goal. The path planning algorithm must have a definiton of an executable path and a goal. The start is stated by the current position of the \acs{uav}. The algorithm receives a occupancy grid and returns the shortest path from start to goal. \cite{KLANCAR2017161}

The occupancy grid is obtained as the output of \acs{rtabmap} and is represented in an Octree format. An Octree is a special type of subdividing tree in a \acs{3d} space. One node in an Octree can be subdivided into eight smaller nodes, each node represents a free or occupied space. \cite{octrees_gamedev}
