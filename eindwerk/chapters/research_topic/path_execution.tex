Once a valid path is obtained through path planning, it has to be executed by a \acs{uav}. The path is an array of coordinates. Once the \acs{uav} has reached a coordinate, it receives the next coordinate in the array until the goal is reached. The \acs{uav} reaches a coordinate when its current position is within a certain distance of the coordinate. This value is calculated with the euclidean distance.
