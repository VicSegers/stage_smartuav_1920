An executable path is defined as a path that the \acs{uav} can traverse. In other words, the path must be free of obstacles and account for the size of the \acs{uav} with an added margin. Because of the indoor environment, the path of the \acs{uav} must be precise and realistic. Therefore, the path should not be too close to walls, under tables, through cabinets, or other risks. At last, the path preferably should be as smooth as possible. The perfect path is the shortest path that meets all of the listed requirements.
