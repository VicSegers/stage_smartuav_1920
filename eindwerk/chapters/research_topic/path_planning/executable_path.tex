An executable path is defined as a path clear of obstacles and spacious enough for a \acs{uav} to fly comfortably. The algorithm uses the \acs{3d} occupancy grid and returns the shortest path in the space that is not occupied. The shortest path is checked if the size of the \acs{uav} with added margin fits in every position of the path, or else the path is modified until all requirements meet.
