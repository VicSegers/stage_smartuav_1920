Because of time constraints in this project, the initial explore algorithm was not an option, this will be further explained in the section that describes the unsolved difficulties. Therefore, another approach was taken for the investigation. One \acs{uav} would first map the area and find the goal. In this mapped area, an optimal path is searched from the position of second \acs{uav} to the goal.

There are many path planning algorithms out there, but again because of the time constrains, only a few are researched. The main requirements are that it must be easily implementable in Python, can handle \acs{3d} and is flexible to add constraints such as the size of the \acs{uav}.
