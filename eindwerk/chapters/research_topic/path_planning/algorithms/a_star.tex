A* is a popular and efficient search algorithm used in many fields of computer science. The algorithms is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm with characteristics of breath-first search and the enhancement of heuristics. \cite{a_star_brilliant}

Different methods of calculating the distance between nodes can be used as a heuristic. Two of those methods are the Manhattan distance and the Euclidian distance. After the experimentation of both, the Euclidian was computationally heavier but resulted a more realistic path.

The algorithm is very flexible and easy to implement in Python. It can handle a 3D environment and account for the size of the \acs{uav} with minimal modifications. That is why A* is used in this project to get the shortest executable path from the position of the second \acs{uav} to the \acs{qrcode}.
