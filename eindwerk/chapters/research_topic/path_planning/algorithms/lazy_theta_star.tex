Lazy Theta* is a path planning algorithm that can handle continuous \acs{2d} and \acs{3d} grid environments. It is build upon Theta* and uses a lazy evaluation to improve the performance of the algorithm. \cite{lazy_theta_star}

The algorithm is a valid candidate for this project because it meets almost all the requirements. The only requirement it does not meet is the easy implementation in Python. Therefore, the search for another algorithm continued.
