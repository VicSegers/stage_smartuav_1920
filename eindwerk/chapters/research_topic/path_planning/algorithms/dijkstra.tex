Dijkstra's algorithm is one of the most famous algorithms for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. The algorithm was published by Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1959. Not only having the option to return the shortest path, Dijkstra's algorithm can give the shortest path from the start to every other node.

The algorithm was researched because of its popularity but is not all that useful in this project. Because Dijkstra's algorithm excels at searching in a graph and not in a grid.
