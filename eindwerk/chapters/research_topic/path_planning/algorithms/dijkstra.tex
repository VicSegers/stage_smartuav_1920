Dijkstra's algorithm is one of the most famous algorithms for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. The algorithm was published by Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1959. Not only having the option to return the shortest path, Dijkstra's algorithm can give the sortest path from the start to every other node.
