The main property of an indoor environment is that it is enclosed with walls, a ceiling, and a floor. The most important difference with an outdoor environment is that there is no option to use a \acs{gps}. The \acs{gps} signals may be obstructed or even blocked by the walls and ceiling. Moreover, the accuracy of the signals is not precise enough to function in such a small environment. In an indoor environment, it is not possible to fly higher than the ceiling, in contrast to an outdoor environment where there is no practical height limit.
