The main property of an indoor environment is that it is enclosed with walls, a ceiling, and a floor. An indoor environment is generally smaller than an outdoor environment. Therefore it is easier to map, but harder to navigate.

The easiest way for localization in an outdoor environment is the usage of a \acs{gps}. However, the \acs{gps} is not only blocked by the walls and ceiling of an indoor environment, it is also not accurate enough for precise navigation.
