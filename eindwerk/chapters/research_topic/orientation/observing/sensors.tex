A sensor is a piece of hardware mounted on the \acs{uav} that gathers data about the environment or itself is some way. A \acs{uav} has many sensors already attached to it, but there is a numerous amount of sensors that can be added. For example, different types of cameras or \acsp{lidar}. The sensors used in this project are picked by conducting research, using common sense, and by the requirements of the implemented \acs{slam} algorithm.

The most commonly used sensors for \acs{slam} algorithms are optical sensors. Optical sensors may be \acs{1d}, \acs{2d}, or \acs{3d} \acsp{lidar}, \acs{2d} or \acs{3d} sonar sensors, or a monocular, stereo or \acs{rgbd} camera. All sensors have their pros and cons, depicted in table~\ref{tab:sensors} \cite{slam_sensor_handover}
