A sensor is a piece of hardware mounted on the \acs{uav} that gathers data about the environment or itself is some way. There is are numerous sensors that can be attached to a \acs{uav}. For example a camera, a \acs{lidar}, a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and many more. The used sensors are picked by conducting research, using common sense, and by the requirements of an implemented \acs{slam} algorithm.

The most commonly used sensors for \acs{slam} algorithms are optical sensors. Optical sensors may be \acs{1d}, \acs{2d}, or \acs{3d} \acsp{lidar}, \acs{2d} or \acs{3d} sonar sensors, or a normal or a depth camera. All sensors have their pros and cons, for example consistency, price, or weight.
