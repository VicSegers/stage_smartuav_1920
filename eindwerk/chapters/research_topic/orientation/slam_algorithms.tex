The decision of what \acs{slam} algorithms are eligible for use, depends on a couple of requirements stated by the project. The algorithm must output a \acs{3d} dense point cloud with pose estimation of the \acs{uav}. This pose estimation is used for path planning later on. With these constraints in mind, a few algorithms were researched.
