ORB\hyp{}SLAM2 is a real\hyp{}time \acs{slam} algorithm suitable for monocular, stereo and \acs{rgbd} cameras. It can handle loop closures and has relocalization capabilities. ORB-SLAM2 was developed in 2017 by Ra\'ul Mur\hyp{}Artal, Juan D. Tard\'os, J. M. M. Montiel, and Dorian G\'alvez\hyp{}L\'opez. The algorithm returns a sparse \acs{3d} reconstruction with true scale. \cite{orb_slam2_github} \cite{mur_orb_slam_2}

The algorithm has an option to compiled with \acs{ros}. Therefore it seemed a reasonable option for this project. After the implementation and some experimenting with ORB\hyp{}SLAM2, it became clear that the density of the point cloud was to sparse for this project.
