% exploration

There is currently no \acs{ros} algorithm for exploration in a \acs{3d} environment. The first \acs{uav} should utilize such an algorithm. Because of the time constraint of the project, the first \acs{uav} executes a predetermined path that leads to the \acs{qrcode} which acts as the goal for the following \acs{uav}.
