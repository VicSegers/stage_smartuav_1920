This project made it possible for many developers to develop \acs{uav} applications without much trouble setting up a development environment. This is achieved by the created architecture, which is practically a finished product. The showcase is developed with the architecture to demonstrate that it actually works.

On the other hand, the showcase is far from a finished product but has made it clear where further research and development is needed. The research in this project has made it clear that currently \acs{2d} autonomous navigation is reasonably evolved, but the \acs{3d} aspect is still in its infancy. This project hopefully made it clear where the shortcomings are in the \acs{3d} autonomous navigation in the researched technology suite.

Fixing the problem where the \acs{uav} cannot fly straight over long distances, was a problem during development, and if fixed the development would go a lot smoother. This would make the testing phase much more consistent when navigating through narrow environments.
