This project made it possible for many developers to develop \acs{uav} applications without much trouble setting up a developement environment. This is achieved by the created architecture, which is practically a finish product.

On the other hand the showcase is far from a finished product, but has made it clear where further research and development is needed. The research in this project has made it clear that currently \acs{2d} autonomous navigation is reasonably evolved, but the \acs{3d} aspect is still in its infancy.
